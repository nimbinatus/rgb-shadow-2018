# Getting Started

First, I recommend
[getting started with GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/setup/).
They've got a great mini
[bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/) to walk you through
getting an account (it's free!), learning the tool it's built on, and exploring
the community. While technically you don't have to get a GitHub account to
explore the code, it makes things a lot easier if you want to keep on coding!

You can download the repository (or repo as folks often call it) by clicking
the button to the left that says **View on GitHub**. There's a green button on
the repo's main page that says **Clone or Download**. You can choose to
download the repo, including these pages and the code itself, as a ZIP file.
If you've gone through the GitHub bootcamp, you can fork and clone the repo to
get started instead.

The language we're coding in here is called Python. There are a lot of free
tutorials out there that can help you get the basics. Here are some I
personally recommend:

-   [DjangoGirls tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)
    (this covers both Python and a website system called Django)

-   [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/)

-   [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html)

-   [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html)

The scope of today is not to teach you Python but to help you understand what
a software developer can do and how learning programming can help you even if
you don't become a developer and to have a bit of fun on the way.
