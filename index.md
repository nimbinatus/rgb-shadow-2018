# 2018 Rack Gives Back Job Shadow Day

Welcome to the site for my part of the job shadowing day?

## Who am I?

I'm a software developer here at Rackspace. You can see what sort of work I do
on [my profile here at GitHub](https://github.com/nimbinatus/).

## What is this?

This site is the front page for the repository where I've left some code
samples for the activity we are doing, along with any code or whiteboarding we
create while we explore software development.

## Can I see a bit about what we're doing?

Sure! Go check out the [sample](samples.md) I've posted.

## I want to try this!

Awesome! Go [here](get-started.md) for directions to get started.
